Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Through this project I got a better understading of flex. haw we can use flex to place the objects on our page for dektop and mobile version seperately without having to define each measurement.

Creating a customizable nav bar, with features of adropdown list. moving around the nave bar for the mobile and desktop versions.

Most importantly, I learned the basics of SVG image. How easily they are cusomizable in css if we are using the image inline HTML. This was a majot learning on this project.

### Continued development

I need to work more on making the website more responsive so that I dont have to hard code the width and height of the element for each device.
